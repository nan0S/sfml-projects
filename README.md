# SFML projects

There are a lot of small programs/games. Each in separate folder.
One of my first projects - these programs are not perfect, but helped me to learn programming. 

In each folder, there's a compiled program, Makefile to make program and description with images of the running program.

If you want to compile programs, you need to have SFML installed (apt-get install sfml / pacman -S sfml, ... - depending on your distribution).
