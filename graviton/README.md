# Graviton
You fly around with the spaceship and destroy enemies and collect fuel in randomly generated level. Difficulty raises with levels.

That's the game, where I learned concepts of inheritance, polymorphism (I just needed them).

#### Navigation
Use WASD to move around. Press SPACE to shoot!
You can use B to go to the next level (should be disabled).
